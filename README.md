Team speak plugin framework in c#

This should pretty much have everything you need to get started...
there is an odd issue with the icon not displaying for the sub menu.

This is still a work in progress but is usable..

This is a personal project I have been messing around with. I figured I would share so others might get use out of it.
This is not even really a first draft its more of a POC, no tests, not really even structured correctly but functional.
